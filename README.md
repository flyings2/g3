## Problem Statement

To implement Adaboost algorithm using decision stumps.

## Objectives

-- Implement the Adaboost algorithm and a Gini-index based method for learning decision stumps. 
-- Better understand the relationship between the number of rounds of boosting, training error, and test error.
-- Effectively communicate technical results in writing. 
## Dataset

  NIST dataset originally collected by Yann LeCun is used.

## Detailed Description:

--Implement AdaBoost using decision stumps learned using the Gini index as the weak learners. Apply this to the dataset on Miner. The first column in the training dataset is the label, and each feature that follows is a pixel encoding.

--Estimate your test error on Miner . Run AdaBoost for at least 200 rounds . Also, estimate test error using a single decision tree learned using any library you wish, without any pruning.
